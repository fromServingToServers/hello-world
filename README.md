# hello-world
This is my first GitHub Repository

Hey, Pat here!

Just trying to learn the ropes of GitHub.

A little about me:
From Boston, MA
Been working in restaurants for about half my life now
Went to school for Math and Computer Science, but not doing a whole lot with that degree
I love music, learning new things, long walks on the beach (is this a tinder bio?)
Anyway, trying to go from serving to servers and this is one of the steps to get there
I hope to look back at this one day and laugh and smile about how I finally made it into a coding career J
